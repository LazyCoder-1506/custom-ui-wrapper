## Project Description

Custom UI component library built on top of React and TailwindCSS to quickly build simple webapps. Every component is built with unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library and integrated with Storybook for auto-generated documentation.

## Usage

To use the components, I will copy the `src/lib` folder over to my other projects, ensure all configurations are setup, and set the `primary` and `secondary` colours in `tailwind.config.js`. I plan to publish this as a npm package in the future
